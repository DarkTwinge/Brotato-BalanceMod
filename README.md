# Overview
Elites are closer in overall difficulty to each other, more weapons feel fun and are worth using, and fewer characters and starting weapons should feel frustrating or unfun. More items are worth using, and fewer choices are overpowered or 'always-picks'. Knockback is less frustrating, the Range stat is better, Luck is more valuable, mixed-weapon builds are easier to manage, and several bugs are fixed.

The full, detailed list of all changes is here. Below is a shorter summary of the major changes you should know about.
# Change Summary
### Mechanics
* Knockback now never pushes enemies towards you.
* Range gained from level-ups & items is ~33% larger (both the increases and decreases).
* Armor is slightly less effective (~7%).
* Easier to have mixed-weapon builds: Shop weapon-set favoring now accounts for all of your weapons (rather than weighing all your sets equally), and the chances of being offered one of the exact weapons you already have is higher the more weapon types you have.
* Bugfixed Wave 3 shops so they can now sell more than 1 weapon.
* Base item/weapon rarity offered in shops slightly lower; Luck impacts shop rarity more; Tier 2-4 Luck Level-ups better.
* Small tweaks to other level-ups, notably making tier-1 Harvesting weaker and several weaker tier-4 level-ups more worthwhile.
* Horde Waves give ~8% fewer materials.
* All explosions can now crit and tooltips now display explosion size.
* Several tooltips cleaned up to be more clear, hidden mechanics are detailed, & character descriptions take up less room. Additional Quality of Life features such as icons for relevant Fairy & King items. Various vanilla-game bugfixes.

### Weapons
* Torch, Wand, Crossbow, Plank, Cacti Club, Screwdriver, and Sniper Rifle all receive relevant buffs
* Spear, SMG, Lightning Shiv, Flamethrower, and Stick receive nerfs.
* Rock, Pistol, Chopper, Hatchet, Scissors, Medical Gun, Potato Thrower, and Plasma Sledge receive minor buffs; Flaming Brass Knuckles, Nuclear Launcher, and Chain-gun receive minor nerfs.
* Lightning Shiv & Sniper Rifle projectiles now have the same Crit Chance & Crit Damage as the main hit.
* Hand partially reworked to make tier-3 and 4 worth buying.
* Bugfix: Revolvers no longer instantly reload when used by effects that check if you're moving (e.g. Solider).

### Items
Tons of items receive small buffs or nerfs: overall more items are worth buying more often and the strongest give less power for their cost. Note that the goal is not to make everything equally strong; there is still plenty of variance and build-specific decision-making. Some highlights:
* Esty's Couch, Robot Arm, and Padding have been reworked.
* Spicy Sauce has a bigger explosion and proc chance.
* Eyes Surgery also adds +1 burn duration.
* Weird Food is now Tier-2 (easier to find if you have high Luck).
* Snail now also slows enemy charges.
* Power Generator now reduces your HP as it powers up.
* Tardigrade is no longer wasted by Bloody Hand/Donation.
* Ricochet is now friendlier with already-piercing weapons.
* Heavy Bullets now stronger overall but lowers Accuracy.
* Fairy gives less HP Regen and gives negative speed for tier-4s instead of negative HP Regen.
* Candle is cheaper, and thus more viable for non-Elemental builds that want fewer enemies.
* Sifd's Relic much cheaper.
* Alien Tongue & Mutation significantly buffed.
* Medikit & Bloody Hand nerfed.
* Fixed several missing item tags (which make certain characters more likely to find appropriate items).

### Characters
As with items, the goal is not for characters to be equal strength, as it is more interesting and fun for them to be varied. Instead, we compress the difference from top to bottom a little bit so the easiest options are less 'free' and the hardest are less frustrating/punishing. (For example, Jack is buffed and Masochist is nerfed, but Masochist is still a much easier character.)
* Jack, One-armed, and Farmer receive moderate buffs.
* Artificer now deals base damage with Tools (instead of only 1).
* Knight, Loud, Masochist, Renegade, Bull, Doctor, Cryptid, Demon, King, and Brawler receive modest nerfs.
* Mage can now run an Engineering build (turrets causing burn via Sausage) and also handles Gun builds better (extra Sausage).
* Several characters have more sensible tagging (items they are favored to find), e.g. Streamer is now more likely to find structures. Streamer also now gets +2 Armor from Pocket Factory (instead of nothing).
* Starting weapons overhauled to make more sense and to be more fun for random-weapon runs, with several nonsense picks removed and many new appropriate options added.


### Enemies & Waves
* Smiley/Croc, Hivemind/Colossus, and Mother Elites nerfed.
* Gargoyle/Bat, Monk, Chef/Butcher, Mantis, and Rhino Elites buffed.
* Loot Goblins are easier to kill in early waves.
* Helmet enemies have more HP.
* Wave 16 harder. Wave 14/15 Horde waves harder. Wave 12 slightly harder.
* Wave 20 has additional small enemies, making it slightly harder and allowing for more synergy from effects that rely on killing enemies or picking up materials.

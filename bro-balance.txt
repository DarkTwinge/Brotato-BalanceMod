~Known Issues~
* Tooltips for Power Generator & King aren't entirely accurate; see each entry below for details.

~~ OVERVIEW ~~
Aiming to allow more options (weapons, items, level-ups, etc.) to feel worth using more often, and give less free power from lucking into the strongest things. Equipment & Characters are *not* intended to be perfectly equal to each other in strength, but fewer situations should be 'free' or 'always-pick'.

Elites are closer in overall difficulty to each other, more weapons feel fun and are worth using, and fewer characters (and specific character+weapon starts) should feel frustrating or unfun. Modest mechanical changes to make the Range stat more meaingful, knockback less frustrating, luck more valuable, and mixed-builds easier to manage.

Short Change Summary:

~Mechanics~
Knockback should now never push enemies towards you.
Melee weapons change Range more easily.
Armor is slightly worse.
Shop weapon-set favoring now accounts for all of your weapons (rather than weighing all your sets equally), so it's easier to have a more mixed build.
Base shop-rarity chances slightly lower; Luck impacts shop odds more; Luck Tier-2, 3, and 4 Level-ups better.
Weaker Tier-4 Level-ups a bit stronger; Tier-1 Harvesting weaker.
All explosions can now crit.
Several tooltips cleaned up to be more clear & character descriptions take up less room. Additional Quality of Life features such as icons for relevant Fairy items.

~Weapons~
More weapons are worth using: Torch, Wand, Cacti Club, Plank, Screwdriver, Crossbow, Sniper Rifle all recieve relevant buffs; Spear, SMG, Lightning Shiv, Flamethrower, and Stick recieve nerfs.
Rock, Pistol, Chopper, Hatchet, Scissors, Medical Gun, Potato Thrower recieve minor buffs; Flaming Brass Knuckles, Chain-gun, and Nuclear Launcher recieve minor nerfs.
Hand partially reworked to make tier-3 and 4 worth buying.

~Items~
Tons of items recieve small buffs or nerfs: overall more items are worth buying and some of the strongest give less power for their cost. Note that the goal is not to make them all equally strong - there is still plenty of variance and build-specific decision-making. 
Some notable highlights: Snail now also slows enemy charges. Spicy Sauce has a bigger explosion and proc chance. Eyes Surgery also adds +1 burn duration. Weird Food is now Tier-2 (easier to find if you have high Luck). Candle is adjusted to have a lower price to potentially also be viable for non-Elemental builds that want fewer enemies. Power Generator now reduces your HP as your power it up. Tardigrade is no longer wasted by Bloody Hand/Donation. Ricochet is now friendlier with already-piercing weapons. Esty's Couch and Robot Arm have been fully reworked.

~Characters~
As with items, the goal is not for characters to be equal strength, as it is more interesting and fun for them to be varied. The idea is to simply compress the range a little bit so the easiest options are a little less 'free' and the hardest are less frustrating/punishing. (For example, Jack is buffed and Masochist is nerfed, but Masochist is still a much easier character.)
* Jack, Farmer, and One-armed recieve modest buffs.
* Doctor, Masochist, Knight, Cryptid, Demon, King (non-early-game), and Loud recieve modest nerfs.
* Artificer can now do base damage with Tools.
* Mage can now utilize and Engineering build (turrets causing burn via Sausage).
* Several characters have more sensible tagging (items they are favored to find), e.g. Streamer is now more likely to find structures. Streamer also now gets +2 Armor from Pocket Factory (instead of nothing).
* Starting weapons overhauled to make more sense and to be more fun for random-weapon runs, with several nonsense picks removed and many new appropriate options added.

~Enemies & Waves~
Smiley, Hivemind/Colossus, and Mother Elites nerfed; Gargoyle, Monk, and Rhino Elites buffed.
Loot Goblins are easier to kill early.
Helmet enemies have more HP.
Wave 14 slightly easier; Wave 16 harder. Wave 14/15 Horde waves harder.
Wave 20 has additional small enemies to allow for more synergy for effects that rely on killing enemies or picking up materials.


!~--~FULL CHANGELOG~--~!
~~ GENERAL CHANGES ~~
* Range: Melee weapons now scale at 2/3 of your Range stat instead of 1/2.
* Knockback: The direction enemies are knocked back now depends half on the original knockback calculation and half on the position of the player relative to the enemy, meaning it should now never move the enemy towards the player and will generally move them more directly away from the player.
* Armor is about 7% less effective (you now hit 50% reduction at 16 instead of 15). [This probably still leaves it as the strongest general stat, but now closer to its peers.]
* Mixed Weapon Sets don't hurt your shop odds as much: The calculation that weighs shop weapons to more often match weapon sets you currently have (15% of the time, more often in the first 5 waves) now factors in how many copies of the set you have rather than weighing them all equally. For example, if you have 5 Thief Daggers (Precise set) and 1 Scissors (Precise & Medical sets): when the shop is picking a tier-1 based on sets, in vanilla this would give you a 1 in 7 chance to be offered a Medical Gun -- now the odds of it picking Medical Gun are only 1 in 32. [This also means multi-set weapons will inherently be favored slightly more, which helps offset the fact they are pulling in a lot of weapons into the pool from being a part of multiple sets to begin with. Also note the calculation for exact-weapon-match is currently unchanged.]
* Base shop (and level-up) odds for higher tiers is slightly worse, and Luck's potential impact on these odds is now higher. Base Increase-Per-Wave for higher-tier equipment 6%/2%/0.23% -> 5%/1.85%/0.23%; Base Max Chance for higher-tier equipment 60%/25%/8% -> 56.5%/24%/8.5%. Luck's impact on Tier-4 equipment is now 25% higher than vanilla (both positive and negative Luck; caps at +285 Luck by Wave 15 or +157 by Wave 19). Base Max Chance is now only a softcap, with Luck being able to go to a new potential hardcap of -/65%/27%/- at -/172/224/- Luck. (Negative Luck does not reduce the cap.) [Luck affects shop odds significantly less than most players expect and overall has less of an impact than most stats, so this helps align expectations and bring the stat closer to the others.]
* For consistency, all explosions can now crit (Rip & Tear, Spicy Sauce, and Glutton's crit chance affected).
* Clarified various tooltips to be more clear. Shortened several character effect descriptions to fit in the box better. Tooltips for Armor and Improved Tools (Gardens) are more precise. Knight's tooltip color-coded properly.
* Stats now update properly on shop reroll (for Padding & Saver).
* The reroll button for level-ups is now colored for levels that have a guaranteed rarity. (Level 5, 10, 15, etc.)
Note: Altered and new descriptions will currently not display for non-English languages.


~~ ENEMIES ~~
* Loot Goblin: Base HP  50->2; HP/wave 25->30 [Makes the early Loot Goblins far more reasonable to kill and late-game ones slightly harder to kill.]
* Helmet Enemy: Base HP 8->4; HP/wave 3->4.5  [Aim is to make them feel like a more meaningful presence on the field, especially for Wave 16 where, when buffed, they go from 185hp in vanilla to 250hp in Balance Mod.]
* Tentacles: Fruit Drop Chance 1% -> 2%; Convert-to-Item-Crate Chance 1% -> 4%

Small Charger: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 80%
Small Viking Charger: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 80%
Tall Bruiser: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 90%
Tall Armored Bruiser: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 90%
Hatched Slasher: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 90%
Lamprey Fish: Knockback Resistance 100% -> 90%
Spawned Magician: Knockback Resistance 0% -> 40% [Should make them a little easier to kill with higher-knockback melee weaponry.]

~~ ELITES ~~
* Mom Elite: Phase 1 Initial Cooldown 2s->1.25s; Phase 2 now switches between a) summoning rapidly (9 Fins per second, current behavior) but slicing half the time, and b) summoning slowly (3 Fins per second) and slicing constantly (current behavior)
* Smiley Elite: Contact Damage Per Wave 1.5 -> 1.3 [~2-5 less damage]; Phase 2 Circle Size 450->490; Phase 2 Cooldown 0.75s -> 0.92s
* Hivemind Elite: Phase 1 Projectile Count 50 -> 47; Phase 2 Cooldown 0.9s -> 1.2s [Aiming to give melee slightly more wiggle room in Phase 1, and everyone a bit more breathing room during the onslaught of Phase 2.]
* Monk Elite: Now has same HP scaling as every other Elite (700->750)
* Gargoyle Elite: Base Speed 350 -> 365; Phase 1 Initial Cooldown 2s->1.25s; Phase 1 Circle Size 1000->940; Switch from Phase 1 to 2 Timing 30s elapsed -> 25s or 60% HP -> 65% HP; Phase 2 Movement Speed 75% -> 85%; Phase 2 Projectiles 12->22 & Projectile Spread 600->710; Phase 3 Projectiles-per-burst 3->4 & Projectile Speed 200->235; Phase 3 Distance-from-Player 225->270 [So it's not such a convenient distance to just sit and smack with melee weapons]
* Rhino Elite: Base Speed 250 -> 275; Phase 1 Charge Speed 900->1150 (& Charge Duration 1.0->0.95); Phase 2 Charge Speed 1000->1050

~~ WAVE SPAWNS ~~
Wave 14: Helmet Spawns 108 -> 85 (Helmets have more HP; this is slightly more total HP); Single Magician Spawns 1-2 x6 -> 1-1 x5 [Removes the variance which removes the chance for an especially unlucky wave, and makes it so _most_ of the fireball hurlers come from the Wizard Hats which you have more control over.]
Wave 15: Helmet Spawns 114 -> 95 (Helmets have more HP; this is moderately more total HP)
Wave 16: Helmets have more HP but just as many spawn; 2 Flies added to each group of Helmets + Buffers (28 total); 2 additional groups of 1 Bruiser + 1 Armored Bruiser spawn, and they show up 10 seconds earlier (18 -> 22)
Wave 20: Added a handful of additional Basic Alien and Fin spawns primarily to help out effects which are based on enemy/material counts.
Wave 14 & 15 Horde: Added 6 single Magician spawns alongside 6 single Wizard Hats (Spawners) spread out over the last 2/3rds of the wave; Removed several groups of easier enemies so they no longer simply despawn the more-threatening ones that naturally come with Wave 14/15; Made the Horde additions identical for 14/15; Made the added Helmets and Fins in the 2nd half spawn on the edges of the map to make them harder to deal with. [Aiming to make these Horde waves still feel threatening, rather than possibly easier and simply more profitable than their non-Horde counterparts.]


~~ LEVEL-UPS ~~
* Luck: 5/10/15/20 -> 5/11/18/26
* Harvesting Tier-1: 5->4; Tier-4: 12->15

Primitive: 3HP Per -> 2HP Per
Guns: 10/20/30/40/50 Range -> 2/4/6/8/10 Attack Speed [Guns having a big pile of free Range is part of why they don't care about the stat much at all.]

Terrified Onion: Price 15->12; -6 Luck -> -5 Luck

Glass Canon: Price 75->68
Lucky Charm: Price 75->72
Poisonous Tonic: 15 Range -> 17
Power Generator: Price 65->72; -5% Damage -> -1 Max HP Per 5% Speed [Note: Currently the tooltip is slightly wrong, and will claim you're at e.g. -1 HP when your Speed is between 1% and 4% and you're still actually at -0 HP; it only counts every full 5%.]
Rip and Tear: Can now crit for 1.5x damage (base Crit Chance 1%)

Exoskeleton: Price 90->105; Armor 5 -> 4
Explosive Shells: Explosion Damage +60% -> +50%; Explosion Size +15% -> +20%; -15% Damage -> -7% Damage [So it fits in more reasonably with mixed builds, and with a little more emphasis on the more-unique size rather than just damage.]
Extra Stomach: Price 100->110
Focus: Price 110->100; Attack Speed penalty per weapon -3% -> -4%
Gnome: 10 Melee Damage -> 12; 10 Elemental Damage -> 8

~~ WEAPONS: MELEE ~~
Cacti Club: Melee Base Damage 10/20/30/50 -> 10/20/30/45; Melee Scaling 80%(All) -> 80%/88%/95%/100%; Projectile Base Damage 1(All) -> 1/1/2/2; Projectile Damage Scaling: 50%(All) -> 50%/55%/58%/60%; Projectile Count 3/4/5/6 -> 3/4/5/7
Chopper: Range 125/135/150/180 -> 135/150/165/180; HP Scaling 20%(All) -> 20%/20%/25%/25%; Base Damage 6/12/18/30 -> 6/12/16/28 [Similar damage at medium HP, more damage at high HP.]
Fighting Stick renamed Bokken. [It should not have "Stick" in the name, and a training sword fits thematically with the weapon's sword-like attack pattern as well as the experience-based scaling.]
Flaming Brass Knuckles: Burn 8x5/12x6/15x7 -> 8x3/12x4/15x5 [More in-line with other Elemental weapons, so it doesn't overshadow them as much while still having its high direct damage and good Melee scaling.]
Hand: Price 10/22/45/91 -> 9/19/36/69; Harvesting 3/6/9/18 -> 2/5/10/20 [This progression makes it worth upgrading past Blue-tier.]
Hatchet: Range 125->135
Lightning Shiv: Projectile Base Damage 5/8/12/15 -> 4/6/9/13 [Requires a bit more investment to get to the bananas damage this weapon often achieves.]
Plank: Explosion Size 75% (All) -> 80%/90%/100%/110%; Scaling: 50%/55%/60%/65% -> 50%/60%/70%/80%
Plasma Sledgehammer: Renamed Plasma Sledge [Makes room to show the weapon's tags.]
Rock: Price 10/22/45/91 -> 10/20/41/83; Knockback 5/5/5/5 -> 4/6/8/10 [A weaker weapon, but purchaseable at a low price and provides a good amount of defensive stats via the direct bonuses and set bonuses.]
Scissors: Crit Damage x2/x2/x2/x2 -> x2/x2.15/x2.3/x2.5 [Now fits in more sensibly with a Precise build.]
Screwdriver: Range 125 -> 135; Cooldown 1.05/1.0/0.97/0.87 -> 0.91/0.86/0.80/0.73
Spear: Range 350/375/400/500 -> 325/350/375/450; Cooldown 1.52/1.40/1.28/1.24 -> 1.53/1.41/1.29/1.22 [Slightly slower attacks at all tiers, but the Range reduction makes tier-4 still slightly faster net.]
Stick: Damage Scaling 100%(All) -> 80%/88%/95%/100%; Flat Damager Per Stick 4/6/8/10 -> 3/5/7/9
Torch: Now has 1 Spread at tier 2/3/4 (like Snake); Larger hitbox [Now will actually hit enemies right on top of you like most weapons can]; Melee Damage Scaling 50%(All) -> 75%(All); Base Damage 1(All) -> 1/2/2/4; Burn 3x3/5x4/8x5/12x8 -> 4x4/5x5/10x7/17x9 [Long burn duration alongside built-in spread to add additional utility and hopefully combo well with other burn sources.]

~~ WEAPONS: RANGED ~~
Chain-gun: Long Reload Cooldown 2.04s -> 3.71s; Accuracy 80% -> 55% [For reference, White SMG is 70%.]
Crossbow: Price 18/36/66/140 -> 13/29/62/128; Range 350 -> 325; Crit Damage x1.5/x1.75/x2.0/x2.25 -> x1.6/x1.8/x2.0/x2.3; Cooldown 1.13(All) -> 1.12/1.12/1.08/1.05 [Lower price helps its early game weakness significantly; Better cooldown helps the higher-tiers actually feel like a useful improvement over tier-2.]
Double-barrel Shotgun: Knockback 8 -> 5
Flamethrower: Price: 56/103/207 -> 58/103/187; Range 300/350/400 -> 250/275/300 ; Burn 3x5/4x6/5x8 -> 2x4/3x5/5x6 ; Cooldown 0.12/0.12/0.09 -> 0.22/0.16/0.09 [This allows the weapon to still be powerful in most Elemental builds, but no longer overshadows other Elemental weapons so drastically.]
Medical Gun: Cooldown 0.95/0.87/0.78/0.62 -> 0.92/0.85/0.75/0.60; Range 400 -> 375; Tier-3 Damage 20 -> 22
Nuclear Launcher: Cooldown 2.12 -> 2.20; Base Damage 60/120 -> 50/100; Ranged Scaling 100%/100% -> 125%/125%; Elemental Scaling 100%/100% -> 150%/150% [Similar strength on Elemental builds, a bit weaker otherwise.]
Pistol: Price 10/22/45/91 -> 10/20/41/83; Knockback 15 -> 10
Potato Thrower: Price 36/69/139 -> 33/65/118; Base Damage 1 (All) -> 2/3/4
Revolver: Tier-1 Price 20 -> 18
Rocket Launcher: Range 500/550/600 -> 500(All)
SMG: Range 400 -> 325; Cooldown ~10% worse (All Tiers)
Sniper Gun: Renamed Sniper Rifle; Range 800/1000 -> 600/700; Ranged Damage Scaling 100%(All) -> 200%/250%; Projectile Base Damage 5->4; Projectile Crit Chance 3%/3% -> 20%/20%; Projectile Crit Damage 2.0/2.0 -> 3.0/4.0 [Given that it's in the Gun Set, it should at least passably scale from Ranged Damage and fit into a Gun build - even with these scaling amounts it still scales worse than a Pistol. Additionally, the weapon often under-performs for its cost and rarity, and one would expect the projectiles to crit the same as the main shot.]
Wand: Scaling 50%/65%/80%/100% -> 60%/75%/85%/100%; Burn 3x3/5x4/8x5/12x6 -> 3x3/8x3/12x4/16x5; Cooldown 0.87/0.78/0.70/0.53 -> 0.83/0.77/0.68; Base Damage 1(All) -> 1/2/3/4; Knockback 10 -> 7 [Relevantly more front-loaded damage. The slight cooldown buff lets you get 1 extra kill on wave 1.]

Chain-gun, Gatling Laser, Tier-4 Minigun: Fixed cooldown to no longer incorrectly display in red (visual change only).
Other Minor Accuracy Tweaks (mostly only relevant if Accuracy is lowered by Heavy Bullets): Pistol 0.9(Tier1-3)->1.0(All); Medical Gun 0.9(Tier1-3)->1.0(All); SMG 0.7/0.75/0.8/0.85->0.7/0.74/0.77/0.8; Mini-gun 0.85/1.0 -> 0.8/1.0; Shotgun 0.9/0.95/1.0/1.0->0.9(All); Potato Thrower 0.9(All)->1.0(All); Rocket Launcher 0.8/0.9/1.0-> ; 0.9(All) [For reference, Revolver is 0.9(All), and most other unlisted weapons are 1.0(All).]


~~ CHARACTERS ~~
Artificer: Tools Have +100% Damage. [This lets them use Screwdriver/Wrench without their melee hit being stuck at 1 damage hits.]
Brawler: Now applies their +AttackSpeed Bonus to weapons that scale with Attack Speed (Claw)
Crazy: No longer starts with a Knife; Now applies their +Range Bonus to weapons that scale with Range (Crossbow & Sniper Rifle); Starting Dodge -30% -> -20% [Silly, but if this isn't going to be -100%, it might as well be an amount you can theoretically pull out of the deficit if you really want to, especially with Crossbow Set giving some Dodge]; Starting Engineering -10 -> -20; Starting Ranged Damage -10 -> -20 [To prevent Crossbows from being overly strong.]
Cryptid: Bonus XP/Gold Per Living Tree 12 -> 10; Range -100 -> -75 (Same range as vanilla for melee, slightly more for ranged)
Cyborg: No longer favored to find Engineering Items; now favored to find Structure Items specifically.
Demon: Materials to 1 HP Ratio 13 -> 14
Doctor: Harvesting 5 -> 0; HP Regeneration is Doubled -> HP Regeneration modifications are increased by 100% [This is mostly the same (technically a very minor nerf), but makes it much more clear what your HP Regen is actually at.]
Explorer: No longer favored to find 'Pickup' Items (Metal Detector, Baby Elephant, Cute Monkey, Pickup Range, Material Attract).
Farmer: Now starts with a Garden; Now also favored to find Gardens in the shop [An overall buff to a weak character (that is also more impacted by nerfs to tier-1 Harvesting and Fertilizer than others), and one that is most impactful for their weaker, non-Pruner-based builds.]
Glutton: Now also favored to find Gardens in the shop; Explosion crit chance now properly affected by Crit Chance (base chance is still 3%)
Jack: Bonus to Bosses 75% -> 80%; Damage from enemies +50% -> +40% [Small buffs to make a difficult character a little less punishing.]
King: Now only gives Attack Speed and Damage for every *different* tier-4 weapon; Bonus Attack Speed & Damage 25% -> 20%; now shows an icon for tier-1 and tier-4 items you haven't purchases yet. [Note the tooltip is currently bugged and will still show every tier-4 weapon, but only different ones will affect your actual stats.]
Knight: 2 Melee Damage per 1 Armor -> 3 Melee Damage per 2 Armor; Armor 5 -> 4 [Makes a strong character a bit less 'free', and means that an Armor level-up is no longer *strictly* better than Melee Damage.]
Loud: -3 Harvesting per Wave -> -4
Lucky: 100 Starting Luck -> 70; Luck Modifications +25% -> +50%; Attack Speed -60% -> -50%; Now tracks and deals damage independantly of Baby Elephant; (Luck stat slightly better and slightly easier to come by)  [This makes you care more about actually raising Lucky's Luck stat and allows their passive and Baby Elephant to hit different targets. Takes a good while to break even with vanilla Lucky (+80 Luck), so gets slightly better Attack Speed to compensate.]
Mage: -100% Engineering Mods -> -33% [Gives the ability to lean into Sausage+Turret combo more, and means Strange Book actually does something]; Now starts with a 2nd Sausage when starting with SMG or Shotgun.
Masochist: HP Regen 20 -> 15; Armor 8 -> 5 [Modest nerfs to a very strong character.]
Mutant: No longer favored to find XP-Gain Items. [Because the effect is additive, they get _less_ benefit from these items than anyone else.]
One-armed: Now gains a 4-Set bonus of whichever weapon they have equipped (except for Legendary). [A specialized buff to a difficult character that really helps some of their less-viable builds like Shuriken.]
Ranger: No longer starts with a Pistol.
Renegade: Now shows reminder icons for item boxes as well.
Speedy: Starting Speed 30% -> 25% [More room to meaningfully increase from where you start]; Starting Armor -3 -> -2
Streamer: Now gets +2 Armor from Pocket Factory; Now favored to find Stand-still Items and Structure Items (All Structures including Garden, and also including Pocket Factory and Improved Tools).
Wildling: No longer starts with a Stick.

[Initial weapon removals (Crazy, Ranger, Wildling) make those characters more varied by making the starting weapon choice actually matter more, preventing the default fall-back option.]

~~ PLANNED ~~
**Esty's Couch: Reworked, New Effects: Price 94; -6% Speed; If your Speed is negative, then: +80 Range; +4 Armor. Otherwise: +3 Ranged Damage; +3 Elemental Damage; +13% Damage; Tagged: Range, Armor, Ranged Damage, Elemental Damage [Use new effects rather than replacing for the main effect since it has all the extra baggage]

Entreprenuer Harvesting tooltip incorrectly still says 5% when it is 7.5% (verify)

Fix Weapon Attack Speed Randomization to cap at +/- probably 60% (instead of 120% for most/240% for Multi) -- hits fewer weird atkspd cases where it floors cooldown such that it gets less beenfit from atkspd than it should

*** FIX: Eyes Surgery's 2nd effect should be added as an Actual Effect rather than hacked into the existing one (which should also let the tooltip update properly to show how much duration has been increased based on how many Eyes Surgeries you have)
	-> Eyes Surgery to up the duration for Blue Turrets (Currently doesn't show in tooltip at least)

Power Gen new malus displays wrong (and also show "+-0 HP" at 0% Speed)

TODO: Figure out translation setup for Bokken/Plasma Sledge (Which may not need renaming in other langs, so should only replace English rather than directly replace the raw name)
	I tried to just change the translation key for these, both as a replacement and as a new one, and it didn't seem to work - was still 'Fighting Stick' and I couldn't tell why.

Give Chunky %damage from temp max HP like Padding or Stone Skin rather than only perm HP.

~{Coded but not implemented due to Utils timing sadness :(}~
- Bugfixed inaccurated long cooldown tooltip for Revolver & Chain-gun.
- Contextual extra decimal place for low cooldowns.

~~ OTHER PONDERINGS ~~

possibly hit shiv a bit more in cooldown and/or range? (or t3/t4 base damage)

Engineer -- try plank start w/o Wrench to test viability; if good, remove hammer option and remove starting wrench
Should Engineer get only say 20% worse Elemenetal, for new Tyler, Sausage, Book?
Engineer 10 Base/25% bonus -> 5 base/50% bonus?  (or similar, 8/30% or 6/40% or whatever, since 50% sounds too high)


Farmer tooltip should count how much harvesting gained

Renegade nerf of some sort - maybe +10% shop prices? [Could be weird and like, Shop prices go up 2% each Wave or something?  To try and focus it more towards late game]

Possible Lucky weapon: Pruner?

Pumpkin should probably affect bounce (test Ricochet first, and retest Pump)
current robot arm rework maybe a bit overly similar to Gnome with Melee and Elemental both?  But maybe that's fine?


loud could also guarantee horde waves?

blue turret -> maybe drop damage slightly and up scaling to 35% so rounding is less awful?

could give plasma sledge & power fist tier-3s a touch more explosion chance?
	sledge certainly seems to be a touch disappointing most of the time

try potato thrower again on Demon sometime

Landmines 15->13, since they're worse than turret? (or 14/16) [maybe just leave it]

eyes surgery - do more tests, might be worth lowering cost too.
	Might also drop torch's very high duration slightly? hmmm

more isolated Shiv testing to see how often the bouce hits the same thing you are hitting, or if it gets bounus hits or anything?

Should crit chance tooltip mention explosions can crit?

Giant's Belt double-logs damage numbers (itself and weapon) - fix to only show on belt
	I think this is also true for Sausage, and furthermore Sausage claims its +1 burn damage even for ticks that would happen after an enemy is already dead?


Mantis Elite slight buff too?

check sauce/rip and tear tooltip for multiples to see if it lies on dmg; fix if possible

Lucky Coin still weird, not necessarily a problem but...


Test if Fisher/etc. with -mats end up GAINING more from there being piles on the ground (reverse of Jack bug)

Could there be a change to make it easier to find matching tier-2 weapons when you start with one like Potato? [Would this be ignored for King?]
	Would prob. only be for Waves 3-5, but something like an extra luck roll for non-tier-1 if you have... a blue weapon?  or specifically pot thrower/sword/hammer/etc.?

Burn currently doesn't apply to trees dying in 8 hits, but should -- possible solution would be having a separate check for burn to kill the tree after 5-6 ticks; alternatively could apply all duration ticks to the hit-count immediately when it gets hit (or half+1 or whatever seems sensible)


Farmer/Streamer and Explorer/Fisher/Cryptid descriptions for fewer mats should probably be consistent (tho there's the awkwardness of the long version being more accurate and the short version being better for the tiny text box)

Fix the "x2" material popup to say the correct x## amount?


should padding be reworked to be interesting on more characters while not being TOO OP on Saver?  (Maybe fine to just be meidocre and a niche thing for Saver/Endless)


more and more liking the bonus to shop weapons based on having a variety of weapons; 20%/22%/25%/27%/28% ??  maybe more like 18%/21%/24%/26%/28% ?? ... 19%/21%/23%/25%/27%  ...or slightly more modest, 19%/20%/22%/24%/26%



Sausage appears to be having some of its damage counted on weapons *instead*.  Also had Alien Eyes, Burn Turrents, Tyler, Eyes Surgery x3, regular turret if any of that matters



SMG tier-1 scaling worse (maybe do this moreso instead of the cooldown hit) [but learn properly how the scaling/rounding works;it's rude if 2 ranged damage doesn't increase]
	Appears to be Ranged Damage is always truncated, and Damage% is rounded, and they are separate; could maybe combine them but then truncate, or? [Verify formula, then chart out a few sample breakpoint spots, probably just for early-game]




can we show explosion size in the weapon info?

maybe brawler should only be 40% atkspd

Extra Stomach should work on Golem when not at max HP. (Currently they can only ever get 1 max hp at most per wave.)
	This seemed like it'd be difficult to implement; would probably have like, a RunData variable to track if you've taken damage in a wave, and if not let golem eat?  Alternatively would have to make max_hp gains still heal you, but the healing seems to not know the source easily unless it can be gotten via the tracking stuff?


Starters
Speedy: -Screwdriver [Left for now]
One-armed: (Probably also remove: Laser Gun, Pruner -- but Pruner is maybe okay if they get the Set Bonus effect.) 
Apprentice could add Revolver to starter weapons; might also removed Pruner (Unless Pruner gets better scaling)


Arms Dealer could have %Damage Tag and/or Economy Tag (Is Coupon extra good or bad on them?)
Should one-armed have Harvesting Tag? (Tho Bee can be rough)


Make Jack's EnemyDamage and EnemyHP multiplicative, so it works more correctly for lower Danger Levels & Accessibility Settings.  E.g. 'change it to +175% HP, and +35% Damage' [Difficult since DangerLevel is the same value as Jack's bonus so is inherently additive; works for Accessibility but that'd be only a half fix...]


Could flatten Pruner's dmg level-ups, e.g. 50/70/85 for scaling or 60/70/85, and 1.4/1.6/1.8 for crit dmg
Pruners could have a more Xbow-like Crit-scaling
	Pruners already pretty good tho, so might need small base/scaling nerfs or something alongside

Could make mat drop %s per-mat instead of all-or-nothing

Glutton melee damage tag is a bit weird but maybe fine.  (Kinda dumb for both Jousting and Shrdder)
Should Renegade be tagged for Ranged Damage? [Already kinda strong enough without it, tho could potentially also get some minor nerf at the same time; would also make it slightly harder to find varied tier-1s]
Should Sharp Bullet be part of the Ranged Damage tag set like Bandana is? (Or, piercing Tag could be given to Ranged & Engineering build types?)


Tyler could have some Ele scaling, more lean into that Ele-Engi archetype the game wants to exist [Adjust based on dps tests]

Lucky Coin: Should this scale Luck off two axies instead of only Crit?  Seems SO situational; possibly retooled as a purple-tier


"Items Price" Text -> "Shop Price" (Needs to work with Saver's effect as well, but probably should naturally?)

Mines: Mildly bigger detection/activation radius? (~+25%?)

Weapons that start with Lifesteal should show Lifesteal in red even if they're at 0%


Could also have part it based on damage types; e.g. 5-10% of the roll checks based on two flat damage types you have the most of (counting melee as x2), starting at maybe Wave 7?

Stone Skin could account for armor from Streamer's bonus since it *is* basically permanent armor (it can change via weapon changes, but not once the wave starts?)


Elemental Damage: Double negative from -%Dmg and Negative Elemental Damage results in a positive damage scaling.
Soldier: Melee Weapons sometimes don’t benefit from the +50% damage, which shouldn’t be the case, since you shouldn’t be able to attack if you’re moving. I think the issue stems from attack animation, if the check deciding if you’re allowed to attack happens before the damage of the attack is calculated, then there is a timing window where you could begin to move.
Structures When Reloading: When you resume the game after having quit, structures lose their ties to items or weapons. So if you have 2 Wrench, you can reload the game, and the structure is disconnected from the structure. So now you can combine those 2 wrenches, and 2 tier one turrets and one blue turret will spawn. Same goes with all other items and weapons that spawn structures.
in func set_damage, new_value definition being defined as int before being rounded causes it to always truncate, or? (Supposedly this means rounding is different for projectile damage than for melee hits)

Stutterstepping with revolver on streamer or soldier instantly reloads Revolvers
 "the bug is whenever you switch between moving and not-moving and have any effect that changes any stat in those cases. Does not even have to be attack speed. So it should also happen with Barricade, Chameleon, Statue, Speedy, Jousting Lance"

Cyborg: Unique SFX when switching modes (rather than an already used sound)


~~~ GRAVEYARD (Probably not going to use these ideas, but left for posterity) ~~~
Smoothed enemy spawns from -Enemies (like Trees) would probably be good, rather than random (so e.g. Jack would get 1 or 2 fish from a Bait, never randomly 4) [This is messy and changes the current spawn amounts significantly; it'd require kind of a weird rework to be implemented]

scissors ~maybe~ a touch cheaper at high end; generally strong enough but still not that worth upgrading [would probably need to nerf lower instead]

[?]Doctor: -100% Attack Speed -> -50%; +200% Attack Speed with Medical Weapons -> +150%

Luck could maybe affect your same-weapon-finding shop bonus slightly too? 

Could slightly lower Laser Gun's cooldown (and probably also base damage?) to let it get 1 extra shot off Wave 1 and 2, so it doesn't get quite as bad of a starting economy hit
	--> would have to be 105->93 cooldown, below current purple-tier, so probably a no-go; just means you're out ~8mats wave 1

Rebalancing Elemental over a 2-per-levelup ratio may ultimately end up making more sense, letting burn damage keep up with the pace of the game better

Egg - 5 base/3 per wave -> 2 base 3.5 per wave or something?  [Aiming for slightly less on 7, a touch more later]

One-armed could Maybe also double Engineering (or 50%)

Fix AtkSpd being stored as int prematurely, store as float [doesn't actually change anything on its own, needs more]

Maybe replace all instances of "materials" to actually mean gold, and add "XP" to the ones that don't?

Could add a pickup-range-only tag to Explorer and Streamer

Is it reasonable to make lifesteal/burn/crit/special effects (e.g. tooth) feel more consistent as to what counts for them?

Elemental set bonus could give a Snake effect for 4or5 in a set?

Red weapons could perhaps not contribute to 'increased weapon find chance'

One-armed, Arms Dealer, Engineer, Entrepreneur, Lich: Description should say "All Damage" to be more clear it applies to every Damage type.

* Bounces (e.g. from Lightning Shiv) should be able to target Bosses like they do other enemies.
* The game should fully stop recognizing the mouse while using controller. (Currently, it will highlight whatever the mouse would be hovering over, so it can look like an option is selected when it isn't.)
* Tooltips for capped stats incorrectly report on your stats, e.g. it can imply your movement speed is faster than it actually is when you have Shackles. [Ideally the tooltip should change to clarify "you would be moving X% faster/slower, but your speed is capped at Y%"]
* Dangerous Bunny: If the current shop already costs 0 to reroll, 

Knockback: Now also reduces speed of enemies charging at you rather than those enemies being completely immune. A starting concept (obviously may need tweaks after testing and further adjustments to weapon knockback values): Enemy charges are now slowed by attacks based on the attack's Knockback stat. Each hit additively reduces the speed of a charge until it hits a minimum speed (and it starts over for every new charge).
	A charge reaches it's cap (maximum speed reduction) when attacks totaling 50 have been applied, with each attack applying it's Knockback stat - 2 (min 0). The maximum reduction is: -50% for Charger, Horned Charger, & Lamprey; -40% for Bruiser & Horned Bruiser; -30% for Elites. For example, a Charger that is hit by a Wrench (Knockback 20) while charging would have the speed of that charge reduced to 82% of its normal speed for the remaining duration of the charge.

Screwdriver could be Explosive tagged

Applying additional burn could cause damage tick to happen immediately (not my favorite tweak but maybe)

* If you have acquired a combined 6+ items tagged Engineering or +Engineering Levelups, or if you are weilding 5+ Tool Weapons: the character is now treated as if they have the 'Engineering' Tag for the rest of the run.


* 

12 base: slightly more mummies

Magician HP and move speed slightly lower which will cover some of the increased Helmet HP; value Helmet HP about half as much?



~QoL / UI~

* Turrets (and Wrenches spawning turrets) should track damage dealt.
* Items should show both total damage and damage during the previous wave.
* Piggy Bank should show materials saved for Entreprenuer (probably just a special case that makes it show difference from 0% instead of difference to 100%).
Shiv bounce count text fix


~~~ MOD IDEAS ~~~
Multitasker Weapons slot UI 2x3 -> 3x4??
-> Lifesteal tracker mod
-> Mod to make the HP above head bigger and always on? (maybe combine this with the louder pain sfx, all part of knowing when you're hit more clearly)
Emphasize player hitbox more clearly so that weapons don't obscure it?  (is the circle even the true hitbox?)
-> Mod to track deaths per character and per wave (where you died)
+XP Gain Value chart->mod [Chart needs to be finished first]
Item Sort that puts active effects (e.g. Anvil) at the top?  Or maybe a border to highlight those items would be easier?
Show actual stat gains in parentheses for items/levels (E.g. Hunter nothing from Harvest, or extra HP on Chunky, etc.)
	There is a mod that does this, but as a replace rather than a parenthetical: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3019195689
-> Show effective actual scaling based on current? natural? cooldown (So instead of "100% Melee Damage Scaling" it'd show 125% for a weapon with a 0.8 cooldown) 
Louder 'take damage' sfx ; quieter weapons (esp SMG)
Extra digit for cooldowns
Cyborg: Unique SFX when switching modes (rather than an already used sound); Golem indicator for mode switch too
Can Elite projectiles be made a diff color?
Loot Alien more stand out


~~~ TO TEST~~~
Test: Verify Incindiary Turret is a different kind of burn that stacks with regular burn (Edit turret page with this if so)
Test: DPS variance for melee from more range (lots of speed to just circle a wave 9 or something)
Test: Sweep weapons with Range, is it both sweep radius and distance or?
Test: Snake meaingful effect (maybe Wand and Flamethrower?)
Test: Landmines random clear (compare mat counts?)
Does Metal Detector give you extra consumeables for Extra Stomach??
Test Pruner/Garden exact timing; does 15s mean you only get 3 fruit?
Do Landmines/Gardens have fractional second timers from Improved Tools?  [Seems to, but verify in-game, then add to wiki]
More precise elite pattern breakpoints
Test money gained from gentle alien [Also on Pacifist, Jack specifically]
Check if Jack gets extra consumeable drops to make up for their low enemy count (code implies there's no such effect)
Test Tyler vs Laser Turrent at a few Engineering amounts
Piercing med turret do anything?
Sick is tagged for Lifesteal, but starts with so much they barely benefit I think?  (Test) -- could tag Attack Speed instead
Sausage wtf didn't register any damage why 
code look does blue turret actually stack with fire
Cute MOnkey/Lucky proc one or multi times from a x2+ material?  [Edit Monkey to be 100% test at non-full HP]
Does WanderBot delay enemy scripts?
Peacock + Negative Armor stacking?
Ugly Tooth doesn't get applied from Burn/Lucky?  (verify)
Burn turrents round damage unlike almost everything else which trunactes?? [Is the tooltip a lie?? in-game damage diff??
Check Riposte-killed enemies drop mats as normal
Glutton: Does it not benefit from Crit Chance?  (supposed to be 3%/1.5x, but heard claims of max crit and still not critting most of the time) [Is this caused by Spicy Sauce?]
""Why melee weapons try to explode twice? One in collision handling in _on_Hurtbox_area_entered of unit.gd and second in _on_Hitbox_hit_something of weapon.gd afterhitbox.hit_something(self, dmg_taken[1]) called and then hitbox emits "hit_something" signal (This obviously doesn't happen for ranged weapons because hitbox belongs to a projectile and not a weapon). And if this is intended why _on_Hitbox_hit_something do not connect explosion to on_weapon_hit_something and lose tracking of damage?""
Test Tyler vs Laser Turret dps
Does temp Attack Speed from Streamer/Soldier work for Claw/Hatchet?
Negative speed can be positive with Shackles?
Scythe damage effect goes up with other things like bloody hand right?

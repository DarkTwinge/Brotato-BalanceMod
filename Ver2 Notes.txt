~~~
BalMod SMG breakpoints: 1-26-51-67
Each 5 points of +Enemy Damage% is about the same as -1 Armor
13%/51% for Hiker HP

~~~
reconsider jousting lance (tho Blob already nerfed it a fair bit)
sharp bullet giving -Range is an idea
maybe add a few mummy spawns to the edge on wave 20 to further emphasize knockback value?

prob add some knockback to Couch when neg speed too? (if reworked)

Tooltip Cooldowns don't accurately show the breakpoint stuff, so at high atk spd can be inaccurate
	have a parenthetical show amount to next breakpoint if possible?


Sausage should prob proc from Sauce/Rip&Tear since it procs from other explosions


could be cute to have tooltips show highest stat reached for previous round for e.g. Cryptid and also lowest for e.g. Triangle of Power (Fried Rice...)


ENGINEER items could be more common if your stat is higher than the wave
	prob hits wrongly too often, but still kinda cute with like Nail and Shackles and such

if slow tag is to exist, wandering bot too?  maybe just remove that from old tho?

~~When testing Eyes Surgery, try some with One-armed

Could have Mom/Monk have lower HP scaling?
make Monk phase 1 move a bit faster but keep their reduced hp?

more ranged set options for better mixing and more varied vaga options?


~~~~~~
Beta/DLC
~~~~~~


Consider re-buffing Croc a little bit; Phase 2 might be too easy now
Re-eval Mantis v Rhino differences again with the Rhino cooldown changes
Watch if Mom is even hard any more
	--Seems pretty trivial to survive?  Still kinda hard to kill at least with short range melee?



Goldfish could give free reroll, or make the next shop's items cheaper [would be moderately hard; could probably make a new effect type and replace `func fill_shop_items` to apply the discount right before the goldfish breaks, using an else to run the shop code normally so it doesn't go twice\

Dwarf: Counter for Engineering gained

Gangster: Controller down on items can go over to stats not weapons from rightmost only


Tier-4 Brick could give you a Tier-1 Brick when it breaks

Impaled Worm run-away Elite may want to switch phase ar 40s instead of 35s since it's so difficult to hit while it's running away early?  Not strong

Sailor-Knight differentiate more?
	sailor cursed weapons could count too? (and reduce bonus)
Javelin/seashell text 'every 2nd attack' maybe clearer if accurate?


maybe add new turret, prob blue tier
	Or perhaps act like Engineering tag if have enough of the stat?  (How often is this a bad thing?)




~~~~~
ogre - too many waves with plankton/fins/shrimp
Red Screwdriver w/ Ball & Chain showed Cooldown of 0.73


super-speed on wall edge sometimes


baby octopus kinda unnecessary
maybe something else with -hp regen



~investigate mace hitbox

~~~
Flutes could increase enemy damage both to you and for charmed enemies vs other enemies

BM-Lute shouldn't do extra damage itself from the Lute bonus
	How does it stack? does the extra damage refresh on each hit, or is each tracked separately
	if implemented improve their damage/scaling a little to compensate

~~~~


~If reworking things like e.g. Baby Squid, make sure they are removed/added to the lists in item_service for specific-character bans
~
~~~
Engineer halving explosion damage is kinda weird

map could come with a little luck

prisoner elite -- 2nd phase either too much delay between attacks or doesn't attack from far enough away
prisoner range for phase 2/3 probably too low; explorer easily stays away
	tho it also switches phases really fast, which is maybe fine but a bit threatening for sure

~~Cauldron - does it stack at all?

---

1-3 tier-3/4 items that reduces curse
	(verify negative curse doesn't break things)

~
Wave reminder: 17 vampires, 7/14 walrus
wave 6 puffers
~

Does Shuriken want a small buff to its early game? (could cost slightly less? tho already pretty cheap.)

Padding could maybe have both the hp per saved mats AND the hp per mats left on ground effects?  With a small -AtkSpd?

~

Curse tooltip description more details?

Gladiator maybe could go to -50 Luck?




Still consider revert early-exact-weapon changes and perhaps making them set instead

bug with 3rd shop slot moving up -- mirror and other modifier things e.g. curious, fairy

~
(reported bug: Rip & Tear is currently scaling with Frozen Heart.)
Reported-Turrets don't benefit from Eyepatch
~~


	Build Turret "base stats" -> base attributes" ?
Baby/Techno/Captain (/more?) -- XP _needed_ to level up?
"the end of a wave" -> end of wave (Creature...)



Check the new effect for tooltip modifications I made; was I just doing key instead of text_key so they don't need new files?


Landmines themselves could maybe have more Crit Damage
Healer & Hermit kinda weird -- healer is faster and has more hp, hermit has knockback resistance (likely making it *easier* to kill) and a tiny bit of armor.  

Ghost Axe could possibly be lower range (which would help Flints get more kills)
Probably re-look at Wands, maybe direct compare with Icicle (could increase cost of icicles if that makes sense to spread them out more)
	^Wand direct damage was kind of impressive on a Mage run...

BM Set Weighting: maybe don't double-count same weapons?

curve the curse formula more to give slightly better cursed-item/weapon odds at lower curse (same at med curse maybe lower at high curse), but slightly more cursed enemies at medium-higher curse? [And lower the cap for odds of getting stuff cursed for lots of curse, or make it further away]
could make elites/bosses stronger based on curse amount
drop seapig profit down to 4 or 3 if this is implemented

_on_EntitySpawner_enemy_spawned -- Curse enemy odds
get_stat_description_text -- tooltip curse info, needs to also be changed

var enemy_curse_chance = stepify(abs(Utils.get_curse_factor(value) / 2.0), 0.1)
var item_curse_chance = stepify(abs(Utils.get_curse_factor(value, chance * 100.0)), 0.1)
	get_curse_factor:
		return max_val * (1.0 - 1.0 / (1.0 + value / 50.0))
			max_val is 100.0 for enemies, or chance * 100.0 for items ; chance = 0.15 I guess?


~~What does Harpoon Riccochet look like

14-Abyss might still have a pretty empty spot early on that's weird?

blunderbuss tooltip should clarify 1 per mat

~(other hp regen tweak possibilities if needed)~
diploma could swap to -hp regen
exoskeleton could drop the -2lifesteal
maybe scarf
spider could be -regen instead of either
weird food or jerky are possiblities
butterfly could be slightly cheaper as a 'boost lifesteal slightly' angle



could slightly reducing the damage of a wave 11/12 elite be sensible? (keep in mind gangster for lower waves or whatever)



~~~ Medical Gun testing vs SMG

-----> 6 HP Regen of healing equivalent for an add-in medical gun, or 40 HP Regen for a set
~~~


COuld see a mild Ogre nerf
	Test the explosion starting at 5 base damage instead of 10.  (Maybe should be 0.01 crit instead of 0.03 to be more consistent or? Tho Glutton is 3% I think)

could possibly increase the material-drop-off-for-later-waves effect slightly if there is desire for just slightly less money in general; not unreasonable to reduce later-game money a bit without impacting early game, tho would feel semi odd to have less money when theings are pricier


pocket factory could give the explorer effect of earlier tree spawns
landmine item curse is dumb? (prob some reason why it increasing eng scaling isn't easy? does it break screwdrivers?)


~ WL reported: apparently Alien eyes is always taking the damage from the first alien eyes you buy. 

investigate: rocket launchers on builder weren't knocking back mummies
	sharp bullet present


pcoket factory doesn't update right away for techno


Pile of Books tagged Engeering instead of Structure, which is better for builder but kinda weird

potentiall up wave 5 abyss boss hp slightly?  what's the comparison with Crash? [Looks like CZ has a little less HP]

possibly reduce curse impact on some other really big things?


Hiking Poles might want to be slightly cheaper (17->16 path).  A weird-cute idea would be worse base Range as it levels up, which is *probably* an advantage (tho probably makes them mix with other weapons even worse).  Could also see smoothing out the progression a litte, so tier-1s are 65 instead of 70 or whatever, or even 60


Streamer could have a lower income cap and/or a slightly smooth income spot at lower values?  (Not super convinced, by could be interesting to be a bit less snowball-focused)

Bosses could have +0.1% HP per Curse perhaps

preventing bounce/random target from hitting curse goblins would be good; how hard is this?

~~check current harpoon damage reduction (maybe do it in practice against only an elite, also check code)
	take a look at pure harpoon diver for a lark?

Particle Accel slow doesn't work?


Add MedGun Starter Maybe:
Mutant? (if remove SMG?)
Entre?
Baby?
Could get spicy and replace SMG with it on Multitasker
Could test on One-armed, maaaaybe fisher
multi (would prob have to replace smg?)

Wave 11 Elite HP reduces slightly more than 12?

~~Can greek fire work on both burn types simultaneously?
~~Druid + Jerky: does poison hurt you then heal over time?
~~test slingshots vs shurikens some
~~Run some tests on Seashell - is it kinda meh like Ricochet or?
~~Perhaps test Med Guns vs SMGs on ~5% Lifesteal; how much better are SMGs at damage and which is better at healing



remake sickle, prob 135 range, prob consumable healing scaling, prob keep the low hp damage bonus concept
	maybe better to just leave removed tbh?

Could add note on Ethereals that Selling doesn't lose the stats

Evaluate -Enemies% a bit; does it suck enough at reducing all those 1-1 range spawns (that is, doesn't remove them ever) that it should be a higher %?


modest rework of wildling?

	
Wandering Bot: Add some additional effect: Damage, knockback w/ pierce, debuff like ice cube, bigger slow, bigger hitbox...  could scale with engineering somehow

Wave 19 could broadly be a little more Horde-like, to test those limits in a guaranteed spot

Flute could be retooled as a multi-projectile

Mage-Lute
Chef-Slingshot? (thematic partial miss)
Creature Spoon?
Creature Crossbow?  (seems appropriate for kit but soft-miss theme)
Hunter-Hatchet; maybe Ghost Flint


look at builder internal ban tagging, currently nixes Improved Tools as it is tagged structure; Pile of Books should maybe be tagged struct but then gets banned on builder


Coupon counts gangster-stolen items as value for itself


Possible incompatability with: Mashtato and Pentato ; checked and nothing clear in extensions that should conflict
Possible mod conflict with one of: RerollRNGBalancing , Fixed Camera Solo , HookCursesMore  


~~flute test: friends alive at end, do they give you full or halves on e.g. hiker


Sausage's self-burn increase is not reflected in tooltip
Spyglass should specify both shop and level-ups maybe?
Goldfish should clarify doesn't affect locked



does sunken bell crit
	sunken bell could give flat hp?

fairy icon visual could show at a glance how many items needed with some sort of gradiant overlay?


vaga could maybe go for a different penalty than -5 Dodge, since it feels like this weird unecessary shot at Dodge, but still makes some sense as 'bad defensively', hm.

curse rework: probably lower effective curse bonus at earlier waves to go along with the easier-to-find with small amounts of curse
curse could give lower hp enemies a bigger hp bump


Crit SFX: unit.tscn replace to make quieter sounds? (test with other sounds)


Bull doesn't proc Ice Cube

~~"Melee" attack for Blobfish (and Puffer?), sometimes counts from a turret and sometimes not, at least for Blue; might be the direct hit vs the burn?


Could be cute to have an 8-hit-rule (like Trees) for Eggs and Iron Lungs, so that pacifist builds could destroy them

~ Picky: -10 Shop Price each wave; -10 Reroll Price each wave; +3 Reroll Price for every purchase; +5 Shop Price for every unique item; +25 Luck; starters things you're probably okay having fewer/lower-tiers of, like Spear, SMG; Pruner?  (And verify -120% Shop/Reroll Prices don't break anything)



Recycling Machine not tracking right, unsure if base or advstats (seems to be tracking in Recycling probably but not for the item itself in adv stats)

Add current amount of creature curse strength bonus to their tooltip if possible?

possible Well-Rounded should have Ghost Axe, Mutant the Flint since Flint is cheaper?

Could possibly have negative armor diminish faster, making a negative armor build more viable


why enemy stats show wlarus having ranged damage number

harpoon tooltip mention the lower damage effect


Possible other Sharp Tooth users: Mutant, Loud

Hand could have slightly lower range to be useable alongside other wepaons e.g. Fist more reasonably?

Builder-Blunder start?

Wand may benefit interestingly from extra Knockback if it needs a small buff


~Giant Belt vs Silver Bullet comparison (w15, w20, 15/40/100 crit or so?)


Wrench in Blunt set,
Screwdriver in Explosive set
Possibly Plank out of Elemental set


Tier-1/Tier-4 text blurbs could be color-coded for the color of the item tiers

Riposte could reset melee weapon cooldowns on dodge instead?  (would be Tier 3 or 4 then probably and might need some minus stats, but cute idea)

Co-op bugs: mid-wave crashes, buying Bone Dice?



Will'o'Wisp -- Why? Snowball also exists??
Snowball idea: When you obtain Melee or Ranged Damage, also gain +1 (+2?) Elemental
	Does this moreso just make those items into Elemental Damage items and you still go single build?  Is this okay anyway?
and/or: Ice Cube could be a higher amount (25%?), but only apply the damage increase to non-Elemental

cursed pile of books should maybe not be triple stats since the base is higher

Gobbler may want to take longer to switch to phase 2? more HP in phase 3?

Tyler could maybe be blue
Chameleon could be blue
Honey (but probably messes Ranged Damage distribution?)
Pile of Books would be possible, let you plan that build-around earlier
maaaybe Shmoop
Wandering Bot
Other possible Purples that could be given Dodge:
Sunken Bell
Scarf
Starfish
Wandering Bot [Possibly scaling with Engineering, maybe 5 Eng:1 Dodge]
Mouse
Crystal
Tardigrade

Adrenaline could give 1-2 more Dodge?




base sale for weapons could be +5/10% to more encourage mixed weapons
Mastery downside is relevant for how few things? Harpoon Gun, Baby, Generalist, Arms Dealer, rarely Vagabond/Multitasker?



Goes into 3rd row of weapons: Multitasker, King
	if don't reduce their counts, maybe re-add revolver for multi
Streamer almost wants 3 more starters to go 2nd row full?


clarify druid's "higher chance" in descript if possible?

Explorer text - MANY more trees spawn [cryptid too assumedly]

King -- bottom bit is cut off; but shortening text seems kinda rough

Reported:
UI - Technomage opnly shows 1 turret when they start with 2
End screen indexing bug for controller
Controller cursor should default to the reroll button when you ban to create a freeroll
Bug: Buffers/Spitters (the 'stay at distance form player logic pattern?" match player speed after getting hit with harppon gun sometimes


Sunken Bell - look at HP for highest HP enemies; cursed/uncursed; it really should one-shot almost anything that kills you as long as you built decent damage?  Or maybe re-tooled to do 999999(?) damage to non-bosses in the radius instead of even scaling with anything?  Or could it give extra iframes?

~~This should now be done~~
Revisit maknig Tardigrade specifically ignore self-damage instead of '1 damage'
	maybe rework tardigrade work-around (since it doesn't work if you have multiple, or for scythe)
	maybe could transfer in more info from args to judge; either dodgeable or bypass_invince are possibly things that could key-in on the self-damage?
	could the check if it's bypass_ be handled in the big take-damage function, routing to my modified function if appropriate and the normal code otherwise, letting me overwrite neither function??

weird that the dodge cap for cursed ghost costume is unaffected by curse strength

Gobbler's Hat -- not dodge penalty? (or at least some armor, some dodge)
	could scale down Speed with mats like the Gobbler itself, using Streamer effect


Vanilla Fruit Basket - Fruits +40% at 0 Luck, roughly -- 2.6 fruits, so call it ~15hp in healing?  Around 4-5 HP Regen
	Average fruit for mathing: 10 per wave (~50 Luck, ~1 Tree item)  --> 2.5 HP Regen per +1 Consumable Healing

Candy bag could skip stats with a -100% modifier


Probably not but maybe Tags:
Evil Hat could be pickup




Tiny Auto Knights
confirm when merging two units that are already on the board? (could be an option)
rarity hover tooltip doesn't work while picking relics


improve cursed landmines somewhow - either let curse lower their cooldown, or add maybe 4 explosion damage%
	probably also give them improved crit damage?
	
	
3 Weird Ghosts in one wave -- started at 1 hp when at 60 max hp

Fairy now inconsistent - gives +5 HP Regen when Fairy tooltip says +4, so used formula different than display formula

Stargazer sound doesn't always go off when they enter vat?

Exploring Mace starters... Jack? Doctor, Entreprenuer, Lich, Vaga, Druid, (Bucaneer, Gladiator, and Ogre prob too good?)

What to do about the Sword/Vorpal situation. . .
	Vorpal maybe should not be Medieval (tho I guess some of the idea is that it can mix with Swords smoothly)


Gobbler capable of being mega-slow --- ugly tooth I think


Sometimes going down (controller) on right-most item will move it over to Speed instead of down to weapons. (no ban, no lock button), repeatable if you move into the weapon from the stats area; sometimes to the ban of the item to its left, also bad

~~ Wishlist of new features ~~
* Whistle should count how many extra Loot Goblins it creates.
* I think it'd also be cute of Whistle made a sound effect whenever any Loot Goblin was spawned (both extra and natural ones).
* I'd like to have Seashell also working on Turrets. (Needs to not be counted twice for Builer's Turret.)
** 	Probably remove it from bans on e.g. knight, dwarf if this is changed.
* Treasure Map should have a visible and/or audio effect when it activates.
* Romantic's bonus Range for Melee Weapons should also apply to Hiking Pole's scaling. (I did this for Brawler+Claw and Crazy+Crossbow already, but it seemed harder to implement for Romantic when I last looked.)
* Would be neat if Ball & Chain changed a weapon's cooldown to a unique color when it is at the cap.
* Gangster could count the value of stolen items in their tooltip. (Haven't looked at this yet, might be easy but not sure.)
** Gangster could show Elites killed in Tooltip, showing the actual stat increases



Impr Tooltip:
Count stand-still time for e.g. Coral


Red Knife -5 Base Crit w/ tiny other buff?
Sailor having Dodge banned but Dwarf and Crazy not is pretty weird





CHART:
Demon HP Costs for first 2 Waves
AtkSpd breakpoints (some 'standard' for most weapons maybe like the 201% and maybe 51% spots?  otherwise SMG/Revolver/Minigun/etc. specific

Character: Lose double the set bonuses you have active [different way to encourage mixed builds?]


Warhammer could be Tool Set to make it more findable for Engineering builds?

Additional reminder icons mod, probably omni: Piggy, Torture, Stand-Still,

pairing for AtkSpd + Range are kinda high, could possibly change one (Berserker, Banner, Tonic)
	tweak the banned_item_group if changed
	
Any new weapons (e.g. Vorpal) should at least have their tier-4 pricing adjusted

maybe re-look at the bonus odds of finding matches for mixed builds sometime to see if I want a different rework direction

~~~
reconsider jousting lance (tho Blob already nerfed it a fair bit)
sharp bullet giving -Range is an idea
maybe add a few mummy spawns to the edge on wave 20 to further emphasize knockback value?

prob add some knockback to Couch when neg speed too? (if reworked)

Tooltip Cooldowns don't accurately show the breakpoint stuff, so at high atk spd can be inaccurate
	have a parenthetical show amount to next breakpoint if possible?

weird ghost could  put hp at  3-5 instead for a few more spots it is usable? (e.g. if it works with Bloody Hand sorta thing that's maybe cute?)

possibly fly enemy should have more hp/wave

Sausage should prob proc from Sauce/Rip&Tear since it procs from other explosions

could tweak elite hp so wave 18 has slightly more?



could be cute to have tooltips show highest stat reached for previous round for e.g. Cryptid and also lowest for e.g. Triangle of Power (Fried Rice...)



ENGINEER items could be more common if your stat is higher than the wave

one-armed could have vaga's no-dupe weapon effect to clean up their shops very slightly (makes it slightly easier to swap)


if slow tag is to exist, wandering bot too?  maybe just remove that from old tho?

When testing Eyes Surgery, try some with One-armed

do some comparisons of xbow vs icicle

Could have Mom/Monk have lower HP scaling?
make Monk phase 1 move a bit faster but keep their reduced hp?

more ranged set options for better mixing and more varied vaga options?


~~~~~~
Beta/DLC
~~~~~~


Consider re-buffing Croc a little bit; Phase 2 might be too easy now
Re-eval Mantis v Rhino differences again with the Rhino cooldown changes
Watch if Mom is even hard any more
	--Seems pretty trivial to survive?  Still kinda hard to kill at least with short range melee?


Sailor -- Tier 2 is colored red, should it be green?

Goldfish should clarify doesn't affect locked
GF could give free reroll, or make the next shop's items cheaper

Dwarf: Counter for Engineering gained
Definitely awkward char, tbd if overly niche or such

Gangster: Controller down on items can go over to stats not weapons from rightmost only


Tier-4 Brick could no longer destroy itself but instead cause 1 mat to drop each attack
	or it could give you a Tier-1 Brick when it breaks

treasure map should have some visual/audio cue when procs
	may also want some light base stats of some kind

Spiked Shark run-away Elite may want to switch phase ar 40s instead of 35s since it's so difficult to hit while it's running away early?  Not strong

Sailor-Knight differentiate more?
	sailor cursed weapons could count too? (and reduce bonus)
Javelin/seashell text 'every 2nd attack' maybe clearer if accurate?

romantic's bonus range apply to hiking stick
	^Seemed surprisingly hard to implement, but would still like to


maybe add new turret, prob blue tier
	Or perhaps act like Engineering tag if have enough of the stat?  (How often is this a bad thing?)



Spoon - Even-out HP Scaling (so 0.25 at all tiers), making melee scaling still poor but less awful with 50%->60% (all tiers), and then changing the base damage from 8/12/16/20 -> 7/12/18/24


sound effect entering vat = could be louder, often doesn't play


~~~~~
ogre - too many waves with plankton/fins/shrimp
Red Screwdriver w/ Ball & Chain showed Cooldown of 0.73


super-speed on wall edge sometimes


baby octopus kinda unnecessary
maybe something else with -hp regen



~investigate mace hitbox

~~~
Flutes could increase enemy damage both to you and for charmed enemies vs other enemies

BM-Lute shouldn't do extra damage itself from the Lute bonus
	How does it stack? does the extra damage refresh on each hit, or is each tracked separately

~~~~
prisoner elite -- 2nd phase either too much delay between attacks or doesn't attack from far enough away


check curse special cases, and make sure anything I rework doesn't get extra silly (heavy bullets right now maybe?  couch down the line.)
 ^Verify it is affecting -1accuracy correctly; probably should be since Eyepatch exists but?
~~
keep an eye on plasma sledge; seeming pretty sad when it struggles to outpace planks

hiking poles are sometimes resetting stat counts????

stargazer sfx - louder, always play, only play when it enters vat

~
~If reworking things like e.g. Baby Squid, make sure they are removed/added to the lists in item_service for specific-character bans
~
~~~
Engineer halving explosion damage is kinda weird

fishhook could come with some base generic stats
could be true for treasure map as well
^^Idea would just be to have generic stats more accessible, but given cheaper rerolls probably isn't needed any more?

prisoner range for phase 2/3 probably too low; explorer easily stays away
	tho it also switches phases really fast, which is maybe fine but a bit threatening for sure

Cauldron - does it stack at all?

---

1-3 tier-3/4 items that reduces curse
	(verify negative curse doesn't break things)

~
Wave reminder: 17 vampires, 7/14 walrus, 15 krakens
wave 6 puffers
~

Does Shuriken want a small buff to its early game?

Padding could maybe have both the hp per saved mats AND the hp per mats left on ground effects?  With a small -AtkSpd?

~

Curse tooltip description more details?

How worth upgrading is it for Flamethrower?  Gets duration on purple and range on red I guess?

Gladiator maybe could go to -50 Luck?





Still consider revert early-exact-weapon changes and perhaps making them set instead

bug with 3rd shop slot moving up -- mirror and other modifier things e.g. curious, fairy

`~`Aros reported issues at 1.1.7 - verify before implementing any`~`
Dwarf – I don’t find myself buying engineering - Maybe Dwarf shouldn’t be tagged for engineering, just structures.
Chef - I don't think chef needs the Elemental damage restriction on +200% bonus damage. It could be -100% elemetal damage modification along with burn not being able to do +200%
Chainsaw's text says cooldown is ... every 40th Shot. - It isn't a ranged weapon, so the text should say attack instead of shot.

(reported bug: Rip & Tear is currently scaling with Frozen Heart.)
Reported-Turrets don't benefit from Eyepatch
~~


	Build Turret "base stats" -> base attributes" ?
Baby/Techno/Captain (/more?) -- XP _needed_ to level up?
"the end of a wave" -> end of wave (Creature...)


whistle - track extras given
whistle could make a sfx when looter spawns
^^These both seem kinda hard.  Would be neat tho.


Check the new effect for tooltip mods I made; was I just doing key instead of text_key so they don't need new files?


- Crossbow -- with Range being ~17% more available, is it too strong?
	Still like the thematic-fit idea of better Crossbows getting slower
	One play at least indicated thy weren't super OP or anything, still needs more testing
	

Landmines themselves could maybe have more Crit Damage
Healer & Hermit kinda weird -- healer is faster and has more hp, hermit has knockback resistance (likely making it *easier* to kill) and a tiny bit of armor.  

Ghost Axe could possibly be lower range (which would help Flints get more kills)
Probably re-look at Wands, maybe direct compare with Icicle (could increase cost of icicles if that makes sense to spread them out more)
	^Wand direct damage was kind of impressive on a Mage run...

BM Set Weighting: maybe don't double-count same weapons?

Possible Laser turret should have a small base damage boost?  (do a few comparison points vs burn turrets and explosion ones)

Romantic + Flute is bugged?


brawler nerf -- either basic 5% dodge, or partially lock in negative range like with Dwarf, e.g. 50% mods and -120
abyss - remove ~1 plankton wave 1?

curve the curse formula more to give slightly better cursed-item/weapon odds at lower curse (same at med curse maybe lower at high curse), but slightly more cursed enemies at medium-higher curse? [And lower the cap for odds of getting stuff cursed for lots of curse, or make it further away]
could make elites/bosses stronger based on curse amount
drop seapig profit down to 4 or 3 if this is implemented

blunderbuss tooltip should clarify 1 per mat

~(other hp regen tweak possibilities if needed)~
diploma could swap to -hp regen
exoskeleton could lose the -2lifesteal
maybe scarf
spider could be -regen instead of either
weird food or jerky are possiblities



could slightly reducing the damage of a wave 11/12 elite be sensible? (keep in mind gangster for lower waves or whatever)

should seashell be made to work for structures too?

Could make it so Fisher doesn't see Bait in Crates (would adding it as a banned item work?)  [this is kinda funny so maybe leave it]


COuld see a mild Ogre nerf
	Test the explosion starting at 5 base damage instead of 10.  (Maybe should be 0.01 crit instead of 0.03 to be more consistent or? Tho Glutton is 3% I think)

could possibly increase the material-drop-off-for-later-waves effect slightly if there is desire for just slightly less money in general


pocket factory could give the explorer effect of earlier tree spawns
landmine item curse is dumb? (prob some reason why it increasing eng scaling isn't easy? does it break screwdrivers?)


vamp squids on 17 might force spawn away from the player a bit?  (unlike puffers, to make them harder rather than easier?)

~ WL reported: apparently Alien eyes is always taking the damage from the first alien eyes you buy. 

investigate: rocket launchers on builder weren't knocking back mummies
	sharp bullet present


pcoket factory doesn't update right away for techno


Pile of Books tagged Engeering instead of Structure, which is better for builder but kinda weird

potentiall up wave 5 abyss boss hp slightly?  what's the comparison with Crash? [Looks like CZ has a little less HP]

Some consideration to drop Sharp Tooth from Precise, because it doesn't want to be mixed

possibly reduce curse impact on some really big things, e.g. make curse lower the min cooldown on Ball & Chain less?

~~Check some of the early game deaths to see of I had invested in Dodge early in them; does early Dodge investment hurt me too mcuh?

butterfly could be slightly cheaper as a 'boost lifesteal slightly' angle

~~Run some tests on Seashell - is it kinda meh like Ricochet or?

~~Perhaps test Med Guns vs SMGs on ~5% Lifesteal; how much better are SMGs at damage and which is better at healing

Hiking Poles might want to be slightly cheaper (17->16 path).  A weird-cute idea would be worse base Range as it levels up, which is *probably* an advantage (tho probably makes them mix with other weapons even worse).  Could also see smoothing out the progression a litt,e so tier-1s are 65 instead of 70 or whatever, or even 60


Streamer could have a lower income cap and/or a slightly smooth income spot at lower values?  (Not super convinced, by could be interesting to be a bit less snowball-focused)

Ball & Chain could change the color of cooldown on weapons when at cap?

Gangster could count value of stolen items in their tooltip

Megalodon elite could have slightly lower HP?

Cursed Relic base bonus Dodge a bit lower, maybe 7 instead of 10

Silver Bullet price could be _slightly_ higher

Bosses could have +0.1% HP per Curse perhaps

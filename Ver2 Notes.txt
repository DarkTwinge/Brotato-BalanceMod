reconsider jousting lance (tho Blob already nerfed it a fair bit)
sharp bullet giving -Range is an idea
maybe add a few mummy spawns to the edge on wave 20 to further emphasize knockback value?

check the Snail situation (does it already slow charges without my change?)
further increase Luck's effect on tier-4s

Test new starters:
Lich - Shield
Saver-Torch?


if Obliterator needs a small buff, give the projectile more width

thinking Baby might want a small nerf-buff: +1 Harvesting, +5% Shop Price?

prob add some knockback to Couch when neg speed too?

Tooltip Cooldowns don't accurately show the breakpoint stuff, so at high atk spd can be inaccurate
	have a parenthetical show amount to next breakpoint if possible?

weird ghost could  put hp at  3-5 instead for a few more spots it is usable? (e.g. if it works with Bloody Hand sorta thing that's maybe cute?)

possibly fly enemy should have more hp/wave

Sausage should prob proc from Sauce/Rip&Tear since it procs from other explosions

could look at tweaking elite hp so wave 11 has less comparatively and 18 slightly more?

cyborg switch sound -> more unique and louder

remove sharp tooth from wildling
speedy prob doesn't want tooth starter


could be cute to have tooltips show hgiehst stat reached for previous round for e.g. Cryptid and also lowest for e.g. Triangle of Power

Currently combining weapons doesn't update shop (e.g. Multitasker) - unsure if I'm breaking this or natural

reduce cost of tier-4 weapons as a benefit to Luck?
change Luck pop-up description probably, de-emphasize rarity?




Check if Glutton, Spicy Sauce, and Rip and Tear  can all already crit with other beta changes


ENGINEER items could be more common if youre stat is higher than the wave


one-armed could have vaga's no-dupe weapon effect to clean up their shops very slightly (makes it slightly easier to swap


Fried Rice probably wants a full rework

Honey needs tweaking or possibly reworking; unsure yet

There's now a fruit tag on garden; evaluate if that makes more sense than adding a new tag


recycling machine tooltip "+35%" should specify additive with base 25%?

re-order barricade benefits

if slow tag is to exist, wandering bot too?  maybe just remove that from old tho?

could add commas to damage numbers 5+ digits

reinforce steel tweak?  Look into it; +1 Engineering is natural but math it some

look at ways to maybe make Riposte effect actually useful?

make Lich's descript more clear that it is ALL damage types

Fireball - add Explosion Size

When testing Eyes Surgery, try some with One-armed

do some comparisons of xbow vs icecicle

Could have Mom/Monk have lower HP scaling?

do I change Fisher's name slightly?

Golem should color 'no healing' red

prob drop xbow cost just slightly alongside the other buffs?  to 16 at tier-1, maybe Lance pricing or?


make Monk phase 1 move a bit faster but keep their reduced hp?

more ranged set options for better mixing and more varied vaga options?



what if Technomage only had the price increase for non-Engineering items?  [Obviously play Techo more and sus out if there's a problem that needs fixing first]



test Baby-Taser, Icicle -- can they get first level up reliably?  Pistol?

check structure tag for IMproved Tools, Garden.... maybe Wasp?

If unfixed, check Sausage tooltip - may only be giving +1s instead of actual damage or somesuch?

Vampire could scale off *flat* missing hp if that makes more sense


evaluate crit of various structures and things with Pile of Books potential; e.g. landmines shouldn't have 1.5x crit damage [prob at least mostly fixed?]


Should  weird food be capped/nerfed more?

If not fixed:
Minor: Display for Fireball's effects are different for different tiers. I'd suggest using the tier-2 ordering (explosion, then burn) for all rather than the tier-3/4 ordering (burn, then explosion).

Beta/DLC
~~~~~~

Celery Tea buff
[Immortel suggested Wave 20 regular enemy ramp up late wave]
Rework Druid
Black Flag Curse -> 5  (maybe with increasing the price back up some?)
Bone Dice prolly still needs more than the price drop, but we'll see
